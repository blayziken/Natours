// Description
// Problem Statement #
// Given the final percentage a student has gotten at the end of a semester, 
// you need to write a program that decides if the student has passed or failed the semester.

// If the percentage is higher than or equal to 60, the student has passed the semester.
// If the percentage is lower than 60, the student has failed the semester.

// However, the percentage is not the only thing that determines if a student has passed or failed. 

// A student does not pass if their score is 5 points below the class average.<br> For instance, if the 
// average class score is 70, the student must have a minimum score of 65 to pass.

// If the average class score is 50, the student still needs a score of 60 to pass based on our 
// first condition

// PASS OR FAIL
// IF % IS >= 60 STUDENT PASSED
// IF % IS < 60 STUDENT FAILED

// IF SCORE IS <= (CLASS AVERAGE - 5)

// double percentage;
// double score;
// double classAverage = 70;
// double minimumScoreToPass = classAverage - 5;

// if (percentage >= 60) {
//     print('Student Passed');
// } else if (percentage < 60) {
//     print('Student Failed');
// } else if (score <= minimumScoreToPass) {
//     print('Student Failed');
// } else if (score > minimumScoreToPass) {
//     print('Student Passed');
// }
